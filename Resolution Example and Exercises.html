<h3>Resolution Example and Exercises</h3>
<p>

<a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/novak/resosol.html">Solutions to Selected Problems</a>
</p><p>

<b> Example:</b> <br>

</p><p>
Consider the following axioms:
</p><ol>

<li> All hounds howl at night.
<p>
</p></li><li> Anyone who has any cats will not have any mice.
<p>
</p></li><li> Light sleepers do not have anything which howls at night.
<p>
</p></li><li> John has either a cat or a hound.
<p>
</p></li><li> (Conclusion) If John is a light sleeper, then John does not
have any mice.
</li></ol>

<p>
The conclusion can be proved using Resolution as shown below.  The first
step is to write each axiom as a well-formed formula in first-order
predicate calculus.  The clauses written for the above axioms are shown
below, using LS(x) for `light sleeper'.
</p><p>
</p><ol>

<li>
<i> &#8704; x (HOUND(x) &#8594; HOWL(x)) </i>
<p>
</p></li><li>
<i> &#8704; x &#8704; y (HAVE (x,y) &#8743; CAT (y) &#8594; ¬ &#8707; z (HAVE(x,z) &#8743; MOUSE (z))) </i>
<p>
</p></li><li>
<i> &#8704; x (LS(x) &#8594; ¬ &#8707; y (HAVE (x,y) &#8743; HOWL(y))) </i>
<p>
</p></li><li>
<i> &#8707; x (HAVE (John,x) &#8743; (CAT(x) &#8744; HOUND(x))) </i>
<p>
</p></li><li>
<i> LS(John) &#8594; ¬ &#8707; z (HAVE(John,z) &#8743; MOUSE(z)) </i>
</li></ol>

<p>
</p><p>

</p><p>
The next step is to transform each wff into Prenex Normal Form, skolemize,
and rewrite as clauses in conjunctive normal form; these transformations
are shown below.
</p><p>
</p><ol>

<li>
<i> &#8704; x (HOUND(x) &#8594; HOWL(x)) </i> <br>

<p>
<i> ¬  HOUND(x) &#8744; HOWL(x) </i>
</p><p>
</p></li><li>
<i> &#8704; x &#8704; y (HAVE (x,y) &#8743; CAT (y) &amp;rarr
¬  &#8707; z (HAVE(x,z) &#8743; MOUSE (z))) </i> <br>

<p>
<i> &#8704; x &#8704; y (HAVE (x,y) &#8743; CAT (y) &amp;rarr
&#8704; z ¬ (HAVE(x,z) &#8743; MOUSE (z))) </i> <br>

</p><p>
<i> &#8704; x &#8704; y &#8704; z (¬ (HAVE (x,y) &#8743; CAT (y))
&#8744; ¬ (HAVE(x,z) &#8743; MOUSE (z))) </i> <br>

</p><p>
<i> ¬ HAVE(x,y) &#8744; ¬ CAT(y) &#8744; ¬ HAVE(x,z) &#8744; ¬ MOUSE(z) </i>
</p><p>
</p></li><li>
<i> &#8704; x (LS(x) &amp;rarr
¬ &#8707; y (HAVE (x,y) &#8743; HOWL(y))) </i> <br>

<p>
<i> &#8704; x (LS(x) &#8594; &#8704; y ¬ (HAVE (x,y) &#8743; HOWL(y))) </i> <br>

</p><p>
<i> &#8704; x &#8704; y (LS(x) &#8594; ¬ HAVE(x,y) &#8744; ¬ HOWL(y)) </i> <br>

</p><p>
<i> &#8704; x &#8704; y (¬ LS(x) &#8744; ¬ HAVE(x,y) &#8744; ¬ HOWL(y)) </i> <br>

</p><p>
<i> ¬ LS(x) &#8744; ¬ HAVE(x,y) &#8744; ¬ HOWL(y) </i>
</p><p>
</p></li><li>
<i> &#8707; x (HAVE (John,x) &#8743; (CAT(x) &#8744; HOUND(x))) </i> <br>

<p>
<i> HAVE(John,a) &#8743; (CAT(a) &#8744; HOUND(a)) </i>
</p><p>
</p></li><li>
<i> ¬ [LS(John) &#8594; ¬ &#8707; z (HAVE(John,z)
&#8743; MOUSE(z))] </i> <i> (negated conclusion) </i> <br>

<p>
<i> ¬ [¬ LS (John) &#8744; ¬ &#8707; z (HAVE (John, z) &#8743; MOUSE(z))] </i> <br>

</p><p>
<i> LS(John) &#8743; &#8707; z (HAVE(John, z) &#8743; MOUSE(z))) </i> <br>

</p><p>
<i> LS(John) &#8743; HAVE(John,b) &#8743; MOUSE(b) </i>
</p></li></ol>

<p>
The set of CNF clauses for this problem is thus as follows:
</p><ol>

<li>
<i> ¬ HOUND(x) &#8744; HOWL(x) </i>
<p>
</p></li><li>
<i> ¬ HAVE(x,y) &#8744; ¬ CAT(y) &#8744; ¬ HAVE(x,z) &#8744; ¬ MOUSE(z) </i>
<p>
</p></li><li>
<i> ¬ LS(x) &#8744; ¬ HAVE(x,y) &#8744; ¬ HOWL(y) </i>
<p>
</p></li><li> 
<ol>

<li>
<i> HAVE(John,a) </i>
<p>
</p></li><li>
<i> CAT(a) &#8744; HOUND(a) </i>
</li></ol>

<p>
</p></li><li> 
<ol>

<li>
<i> LS(John) </i>
<p>
</p></li><li>
<i> HAVE(John,b) </i>
<p>
</p></li><li>
<i> MOUSE(b) </i>
</li></ol>

</li></ol>

<p>
Now we proceed to prove the conclusion by resolution using the above clauses.
Each result clause is numbered; the numbers of its parent clauses are shown
to its left.
</p><p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>
[1.,4.(b):] </td><td> 6. </td><td> <i> CAT(a) &#8744; HOWL(a) </i> </td></tr>

<b> 2.</b> Consider the following axioms:
</p><ol>

<li> Every child loves Santa.
<p>
</p></li><li> Everyone who loves Santa loves any reindeer.
<p>
</p></li><li> Rudolph is a reindeer, and Rudolph has a red nose.
<p>
</p></li><li> Anything which has a red nose is weird or is a clown.
<p>
</p></li><li> No reindeer is a clown.
<p>
</p></li><li> Scrooge does not love anything which is weird.
<p>
</p></li><li> (Conclusion)  Scrooge is not a child.
</li></ol>

Represent these axioms in predicate calculus; skolemize as necessary
and convert each formula to clause form.  (Note:  `has a red nose' can
be a single predicate.  Remember to negate the conclusion.)  Prove the
unsatisfiability of the set of clauses by resolution.
<p>
</p><p>

<b> 3.</b> Consider the following axioms:
</p><ol>

<li> Anyone who buys carrots by the bushel owns either a rabbit or a
grocery store.
<p>
</p></li><li> Every dog chases some rabbit.
<p>
</p></li><li> Mary buys carrots by the bushel.
<p>
</p></li><li> Anyone who owns a rabbit hates anything that chases any rabbit.
<p>
</p></li><li> John owns a dog.
<p>
</p></li><li> Someone who hates something owned by another person will not date
that person.
<p>
</p></li><li> (Conclusion)  If Mary does not own a grocery store, she will not date
John.
</li></ol>

<p>
Represent these clauses in predicate calculus, using only those predicates
which are necessary.  For example, you need not represent `person', and
phrases such as `who buys carrots by the bushel' may be represented by
a single predicate.  Negate the conclusion and convert to clause form,
skolemizing as necessary.  Prove the unsatisfiability of the resulting
set of clauses by resolution.

are frustrated.

<b> 25.</b>``Schubert's Steamroller'', for the ambitious.  (See C. Walther,
AAAI-84, p. 330.)
</p><p>
Wolves, foxes, birds, caterpillars, and snails are animals, and there
are some of each of them.  Also there are some grains, and grains are
plants.  Every animal either likes to eat all plants or all animals much
smaller than itself that like to eat some plants.  Caterpillars and snails
are much smaller than birds, which are much smaller than foxes, which
in turn are much smaller than wolves.  Wolves do not like to eat foxes
or grains, while birds like to eat caterpillars but not snails.  Caterpillars
and snails like to eat some plants.  Therefore there is an animal that
likes to eat a grain-eating animal.
